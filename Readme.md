## Project Overview
ShipmentSure is a machine learning project focused on predicting whether shipments will arrive on time using supplier and order data. The system aims to enhance supply chain efficiency by identifying key factors that cause delays and enabling proactive logistics planning. This project applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to minimize shipment delays and improve overall delivery performance.

## Objective
To build a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts on-time shipment delivery using various supplier and shipment attributes.

## Problem Statement
Delayed shipments have a significant impact on production schedules, financial outcomes, and customer satisfaction. Traditional manual tracking of shipments is inefficient and error-prone. ShipmentSure addresses this by leveraging data-driven machine learning techniques to anticipate shipment delays and help take corrective actions in advance.

## Tools and Technologies
- Google Colab (for development and experimentation)
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- Machine learning libraries and frameworks: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), etc.

## Dataset
The project uses shipment and supplier data, including features such as mode of shipment, product cost, product weight, warehouse block, and customer-related metrics. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and balancing classes via SMOTE.
